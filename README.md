# Salc 

## This is a simple calaculator program that solves simple mathmatics
This program solves addition subtraction Multiplication division solves exponents and remainders.

## Why? 
There is probably no need for something like this to exist i mean we have graphical calculators.
However this was something i decided to get back into for fun and sparked my interests back into 
Python again. 

### How to use or run this? 
- First so need to have python installed 
- Second clone the repo 
`git clone https://github.com/kjfreidhof/Salc.git`
- Then run the python interperter on the code like this 
`python salc` or `python3 salc` in a command line interface 

- So like on windows cmd or powershell 
- Then on unix-like opreating systems like FreeBSD linux MacOS etc. 
- just launch the terminal
